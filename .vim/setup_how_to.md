# This file describes some useful hints how to configure vim from scratch

* clone dot files repo: git://github/patryk151900/dotfiles
* link .vim and .vimrc to home: ln -s repos/dotfiles/.vim .vim
* clone vundle to .vim/bundle/vundle
* open vim and call :PluginInstall
* clone powerline fonts and call sudo install.sh
* check with Character Map if fonts/symbols are installed - check in common -> A0E1 for line number symbol
* in order to see airline symbols in console vim set the right font in terminal settings - from this time you should see new symbols in vim
* do not configure symnols in .vimrc - this is necessary only if you like to replace default symbols
